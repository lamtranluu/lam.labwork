Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.   \n",

Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary.

In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy.

Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills.

His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon.

Nicole Kidman is the woman and she's the queen of the under\\nsea kingdom of Atlantis and she's running away from all that. The two fall in\\nlove and have a kid who grows up to be Jason Momoa.But before that some Atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap Kidman.\\nThey're all killed, but Kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm her\\nson.One would have to be blind not to miss the parallels between the story of the\\nSword And The Stone and Aquaman. Momoa's earth name is Arthur Curry for\\nthat matter. Now all grown up and quite fit and cut he's summoned to Atlantis to claim the crown. But first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rock\\nsomewhere in the sea. Can it get plainer than that.Aquaman also has a surface enemy in the son of a pirate whose father he killed\\nwhen they were capturing a submarine.I did like the computer graphic special effects.used and loved the fantasy sea\\nworld that was created.I can hardly wait for the sequel.   \n",

It's not particularly awful, it's just that I felt indifferent towards it, particularly with a hackneyed storyline that goes through all of the motions without ever offering much in the way of originality or innovation. Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes. An inflated running time and juvenile script had me feeling like this was a NEMO sequel at times, and it all ends in a climax that just goes for CGI effect after CGI effect, ad nauseum. Try harder, guys...   \n",
       "2  In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea. She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.   \n",

I am too old for super heroes of American pop culture and the only desire about DC films is to convince me. In this case, the result is satisfactory. Because ...Jason Momoa. Sure, CGI, old cliches, the trident and the wise guide, the beautiful girl and the terrible enemy. But, except the effort of Momoa to sustain in honorable way his character, nothing new. Sure, it is a simple, dynamic, cool film for fans and young public. And it works. But the too familiar \"it could be better\" remains present at the end. Not exactly as accusation, but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy - action films. Sure, it is heroic and propose a high noble, powerful hero. But something is missing. What ? Maybe, in essence, the answer has no significance.\\n                \\n                    4 out of 9 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

       "4                                                                                                                                         More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.   \n",

It might work on the Dark Knight but we want Superman to be well super.Aquaman is enjoyable enough nonsense. It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur. It injects fun as long as you do not take it all seriously.The movie begins with a lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry rescuing Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater realm of Atlantis.Two worlds collide, they fall in love and have a baby boy. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film. It is overlong but at least it did not end up in a watery grave.   \n",

Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes.

In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.</td>\n",

In this case, the result is satisfactory. Because ...Jason Momoa. Sure, CGI, old cliches, the trident and the wise guide, the beautiful girl and the terrible enemy. But, except the effort of Momoa to sustain in honorable way his character, nothing new. Sure, it is a simple, dynamic, cool film for fans and young public. And it works. But the too familiar \"it could be better\" remains present at the end. Not exactly as accusation, but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy - action films.

       "      <td>More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.</td>\n",

Nicole Kidman is the woman and she's the queen of the under\\nsea kingdom of Atlantis and she's running away from all that. The two fall in\\nlove and have a kid who grows up to be Jason Momoa.But before that some Atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap Kidman.\\nThey're all killed, but Kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm her\\nson.One would have to be blind not to miss the parallels between the story of the\\nSword And The Stone and Aquaman. Momoa's earth name is Arthur Curry for\\nthat matter. Now all grown up and quite fit and cut he's summoned to Atlantis to claim the crown. But first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rock\\nsomewhere in the sea. Can it get plainer than that.Aquaman also has a surface enemy in the son of a pirate whose father he killed\\nwhen they were capturing a submarine.I did like the computer graphic special effects.used and loved the fantasy sea\\nworld that was created.I can hardly wait for the sequel.   \n",

It's not particularly awful, it's just that I felt indifferent towards it, particularly with a hackneyed storyline that goes through all of the motions without ever offering much in the way of originality or innovation. Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes. An inflated running time and juvenile script had me feeling like this was a NEMO sequel at times, and it all ends in a climax that just goes for CGI effect after CGI effect, ad nauseum. Try harder, guys...   \n",
       "2  In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea. She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.   \n",

I am too old for super heroes of American pop culture and the only desire about DC films is to convince me. In this case, the result is satisfactory. Because ...Jason Momoa. Sure, CGI, old cliches, the trident and the wise guide, the beautiful girl and the terrible enemy. But, except the effort of Momoa to sustain in honorable way his character, nothing new. Sure, it is a simple, dynamic, cool film for fans and young public. And it works. But the too familiar \"it could be better\" remains present at the end. Not exactly as accusation, but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy - action films. Sure, it is heroic and propose a high noble, powerful hero. But something is missing. What ? Maybe, in essence, the answer has no significance.\\n                \\n                    4 out of 9 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

       "4                                                                                                                                         More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.   \n",
