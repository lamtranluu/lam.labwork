They use one formula to create a movie which people will go to watch but then never want to see it again because the replay value is ZERO.Movies with substance have replay value. A movie such as Citizen Cane, Glory, Lincoln, Clockwork Orange, Gone with the Wind, Grapes of Wrath, Dr. Strangelove or To Kill a Mockingbird. All great movies which you can watch again to see a lesson in life about real people with real problems, played by great actors and great directors and great screen writers.Yes, Aquaman is fantasy, but it lacks a connection to being a person. There is no desire to know the main character or cheer for them. You already know they are going to win. You already know they will succeed. The writing is so bad, that they show you the \"finishing move\" for the final battle which is never used at any other time in the movie. It's a copy cat script of several dozen other movies in the last fifty years where the hero is predicted to win while in the same breath told he can't win.Gee, I wonder what is going to happen at the end?YAWN!Sure the action is good, there are some good fight scenes, but most of it was just a bunch of CGI thrown in for the big summer block buster formula. It lacked any fight scenes which I would want to see more than once.Another thing which bothered me is the choice of casting. Aquaman is supposed to be from Atlantis. He isn't a half breed. He isn't from the South Pacific. The story of the people from Atlantis is from the Mediterranean. Why do you think the Atlantic Ocean is called that? Its because of Atlantis!!So in closing. BARF.

Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and everything that comic con nerd culture celebrates. And I am the one who is still single at 35, mind you. But hey, are the nerds so deprived nowadays so as to sell their soul just to watch a femme fatale in a movie with zero suspense?I asked my cousin if it is indeed for comic con nerds or great movie in general. He said the latter. But the thing is I should've listened to my kombucha infused probiotic gut. I mean if I don't like fantasy, then I shouldn't watch fantasy. It doesn't matter if it gets 'rave reviews' or trumpeted by spineless herd, tribe and sheep mentality who will blindly follow the bandwagon effect and swallow anything that 'others' tell them it is good for them.Hence, the mea culpa part. This is why I avoid Stephen King and reading mainstream books like JK Rowling's ones and avoid A Game of the Thrones.But the thing is the intro was pretty cool and got me hooked. But pretty soon it devolved into cringe worthy fantasy scenes. I was hoping against hope that it will get better in Dark Knightesque fashion.Boy. Now I am conflicted as to finish watching it since -after all- I paid 4.99 on YouTube and you can get a preworkout drink with that. I went as far as the boat scene where Diana is about to leave...But I'd rather not; even though I wasted one preworkout drink.Moral of the story? Mainstream media bias will do anything in its power to trumpet any unpalatable content along with mass advertising powerhouses.RIP objectivity. RIP neutrality. RIP class, content and intellect.This is why people likes Danielle Steele and squirms at Pynchon. So lesson learned: \"Never ever get swayed by popular opinion. Stay true to your heart. And even if 6,999,999,999 of the populace says something is 'a masterpiece' or 'out of the park' and if YOU feel it is worthless, pile of cow dung... value your opinion. \"Ultimately your opinion matters too no matter how much it goes against the grain.\"p.s. I know I haven't touched on the content, but let's face it...there isn't a content at all. Just a depiction of a fantasy land with woman in miniskirts and thighs apparently doing Scythian horsemanship and shooting arrows. The point being I got ambushed and conned into watching it because of the mainstream media despite hating fantasy genre from the depth of my gut.</td>\n",

All the characters in this movie are one-dimensional and none of them has any appreciable arc. Chris Pine's character starts off a heroic good guy, he ends up a heroic good guy. Same with Gal Gadot. How about you introduce a little tension and misunderstanding between Gadot and Pine early on? Make him more of an ambiguous character, a rough diamond who is generally decent but makes some selfish decisions, which Gadot disapproves of. She can be more haughty, high-minded and judgmental early on, believing in her own righteousness and thinking he is a scoundrel. As the movie goes on, Gadot discovers her own flaws but makes Pine want to become a better man. This makes the end scene more touching, as her influence over him has completed his arc, he makes a huge sacrifice because he believes in her and she in turn learns that people can be both bad and good, but are better when they have someone to admire. Her arc is similarly completed when she learns that she is not perfect, that she too is flawed, just like the people she previously looked down on.3: Morality: The morality of this film is disturbing to say the least. Wonder Woman goes around murdering ordinary working class German men because they happen to be unfortunate enough to be conscripted into the wrong army, at the wrong time. But at the end of the film she spares the life of a truly evil, genocidal torturer - who deserves to die by anyone's reckoning. Pity is indeed a noble and important human attribute, but where was her pity for the ordinary working class men she murdered? Why does she feel pity for a genocidal maniac who deserves to die? How about instead of having her kill ordinary working class men who were just conscripted at the wrong time and in the wrong place, she shows them pity and mercy, and kills the genocidal torturer? Why make the message of the film that people are both good and bad, but have everyone hugging once Ares dies, as if they were all under a spell? The morality of this film is all over the place. If everyone hugs once Ares dies, just kill Ares and don't kill his unfortunate minions. Were they under a spell, or weren't they?4. Ditch the theme music. Seriously; it's totally at odds with the character you're trying to represent. The director has chosen to make the main character a pure and inspirational goddess, but allowed her to be represented by the raunchy, aggressive theme music of an angry stripper on PCP. I get that the theme tune was composed for a different movie, under a different director, but does anyone else involved with the debacle? Leave the theme tune to the end credits, if you have to use it at all.5. Don't have the Amazons fight like they have no clue about war. They have bows, they have the high ground, why did they jump off the cliffs only to get slaughtered on the beach? It doesn't matter how much technology advances in warfare, you don't give up the high ground, especially to an unknown enemy. By doing so, it undoes all the early work of the film which portrays them as fierce and capable warriors and makes them look like silly girls playing games. If you need to have a scene in which people are dying and Wonder Woman gets to both show off her fighting skills and be tragically rescued, make it an ambush. Watching the Amazons fling themselves from the cliffs was one of the most ridiculous things I've seen in a movie, almost as bad as the time James Bond surfed a tidal wave and equally cringe-worthy. Have them ambushed by the soldiers, you can have the same result with far more credibility and emotional resonance. It's difficult to feel too sorry for people who fling themselves off cliffs, shooting grappling arrows, only to Tarzan into a 8.22 mm round fired by a man with probably a fortnight's basic training. These women came across more Cirque Du Soleil than Amazon warrior, but on the plus side; if their island ever sinks under rising tides caused by global warming, they've got a steady career in Vegas just waiting for them. Three shows a day and all the shrimp they can eat. Yum.6. The sidekicks were a confused mess. I'm not against the idea of having a disparate group of mercenaries all fighting for various things with ambiguous morality, in fact it was quite a good idea to teach Diana the nuance of human relationships and interactions. That said, the characters were poorly-fleshed out and didn't really serve much purpose. It felt like the director couldn't decide whether they wanted comedy sidekicks, or Saving Private Ryan type tragic soldiers, and so chose the former, but scripted the latter. What we ended up with was comedy sidekicks without the comedy, which was the worst of all worlds. My solution to this is simple, don't try to make them all individual characters with poorly thought out back-stories, that don't come to anything (like the sniper who couldn't shoot) - let them fulfill their destinies as comedy-sidekicks who make the audience laugh. You can still add serious moments, like when the Native American is talking about how his land was stolen by Chris Pine's people and Diana's criticism of his mercenary actions suddenly rings childish and hollow. That was a great moment, probably the best in the film in fact. By interspersing comedy banter with serious moments like those, you can created a much more powerful effect than by explicitly giving every one of them a tragic backstory, but never exploring it beyond hearing them complain a bit because you think it gives your movie substance.</td>\n",

They use one formula to create a movie which people will go to watch but then never want to see it again because the replay value is ZERO.Movies with substance have replay value. A movie such as Citizen Cane, Glory, Lincoln, Clockwork Orange, Gone with the Wind, Grapes of Wrath, Dr. Strangelove or To Kill a Mockingbird. All great movies which you can watch again to see a lesson in life about real people with real problems, played by great actors and great directors and great screen writers.Yes, Aquaman is fantasy, but it lacks a connection to being a person. There is no desire to know the main character or cheer for them. You already know they are going to win. You already know they will succeed. The writing is so bad, that they show you the \"finishing move\" for the final battle which is never used at any other time in the movie. It's a copy cat script of several dozen other movies in the last fifty years where the hero is predicted to win while in the same breath told he can't win.Gee, I wonder what is going to happen at the end?YAWN!Sure the action is good, there are some good fight scenes, but most of it was just a bunch of CGI thrown in for the big summer block buster formula. It lacked any fight scenes which I would want to see more than once.Another thing which bothered me is the choice of casting. Aquaman is supposed to be from Atlantis. He isn't a half breed. He isn't from the South Pacific. The story of the people from Atlantis is from the Mediterranean. Why do you think the Atlantic Ocean is called that? Its because of Atlantis!!So in closing. BARF. The movie sucks. Just another crappy movie pumped out by crappy Hollywood.   \n",

I hate fantasy genre. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and everything that comic con nerd culture celebrates. And I am the one who is still single at 35, mind you. But hey, are the nerds so deprived nowadays so as to sell their soul just to watch a femme fatale in a movie with zero suspense?I asked my cousin if it is indeed for comic con nerds or great movie in general. He said the latter. But the thing is I should've listened to my kombucha infused probiotic gut. I mean if I don't like fantasy, then I shouldn't watch fantasy. It doesn't matter if it gets 'rave reviews' or trumpeted by spineless herd, tribe and sheep mentality who will blindly follow the bandwagon effect and swallow anything that 'others' tell them it is good for them.Hence, the mea culpa part. This is why I avoid Stephen King and reading mainstream books like JK Rowling's ones and avoid A Game of the Thrones.But the thing is the intro was pretty cool and got me hooked. But pretty soon it devolved into cringe worthy fantasy scenes. I was hoping against hope that it will get better in Dark Knightesque fashion.Boy. Now I am conflicted as to finish watching it since -after all- I paid 4.99 on YouTube and you can get a preworkout drink with that. I went as far as the boat scene where Diana is about to leave...But I'd rather not; even though I wasted one preworkout drink.Moral of the story? Mainstream media bias will do anything in its power to trumpet any unpalatable content along with mass advertising powerhouses.RIP objectivity. RIP neutrality. RIP class, content and intellect.This is why people likes Danielle Steele and squirms at Pynchon. So lesson learned: \"Never ever get swayed by popular opinion. Stay true to your heart. And even if 6,999,999,999 of the populace says something is 'a masterpiece' or 'out of the park' and if YOU feel it is worthless, pile of cow dung... value your opinion. \"Ultimately your opinion matters too no matter how much it goes against the grain.\"p.s. I know I haven't touched on the content, but let's face it...there isn't a content at all. Just a depiction of a fantasy land with woman in miniskirts and thighs apparently doing Scythian horsemanship and shooting arrows. The point being I got ambushed and conned into watching it because of the mainstream media despite hating fantasy genre from the depth of my gut.   \n",

This film is to be quite honest dreadful, at points its like watching a charity video or a very poor government propaganda film. The acting is poor, action sequences sparse and not very exciting and oh you get it, its a bit rubbish.\\n                \\n                    3 out of 13 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

       "9688  1: Lighten up on the inspirational music. I thought I was watching a car advertisement, I really did. 2: Multi-faceted characters. All the characters in this movie are one-dimensional and none of them has any appreciable arc. Chris Pine's character starts off a heroic good guy, he ends up a heroic good guy. Same with Gal Gadot. How about you introduce a little tension and misunderstanding between Gadot and Pine early on? Make him more of an ambiguous character, a rough diamond who is generally decent but makes some selfish decisions, which Gadot disapproves of. She can be more haughty, high-minded and judgmental early on, believing in her own righteousness and thinking he is a scoundrel. As the movie goes on, Gadot discovers her own flaws but makes Pine want to become a better man. This makes the end scene more touching, as her influence over him has completed his arc, he makes a huge sacrifice because he believes in her and she in turn learns that people can be both bad and good, but are better when they have someone to admire. Her arc is similarly completed when she learns that she is not perfect, that she too is flawed, just like the people she previously looked down on.3: Morality: The morality of this film is disturbing to say the least. Wonder Woman goes around murdering ordinary working class German men because they happen to be unfortunate enough to be conscripted into the wrong army, at the wrong time. But at the end of the film she spares the life of a truly evil, genocidal torturer - who deserves to die by anyone's reckoning. Pity is indeed a noble and important human attribute, but where was her pity for the ordinary working class men she murdered? Why does she feel pity for a genocidal maniac who deserves to die? How about instead of having her kill ordinary working class men who were just conscripted at the wrong time and in the wrong place, she shows them pity and mercy, and kills the genocidal torturer? Why make the message of the film that people are both good and bad, but have everyone hugging once Ares dies, as if they were all under a spell? The morality of this film is all over the place. If everyone hugs once Ares dies, just kill Ares and don't kill his unfortunate minions. Were they under a spell, or weren't they?4. Ditch the theme music. Seriously; it's totally at odds with the character you're trying to represent. The director has chosen to make the main character a pure and inspirational goddess, but allowed her to be represented by the raunchy, aggressive theme music of an angry stripper on PCP. I get that the theme tune was composed for a different movie, under a different director, but does anyone else involved with the debacle? Leave the theme tune to the end credits, if you have to use it at all.5. Don't have the Amazons fight like they have no clue about war. They have bows, they have the high ground, why did they jump off the cliffs only to get slaughtered on the beach? It doesn't matter how much technology advances in warfare, you don't give up the high ground, especially to an unknown enemy. By doing so, it undoes all the early work of the film which portrays them as fierce and capable warriors and makes them look like silly girls playing games. If you need to have a scene in which people are dying and Wonder Woman gets to both show off her fighting skills and be tragically rescued, make it an ambush. Watching the Amazons fling themselves from the cliffs was one of the most ridiculous things I've seen in a movie, almost as bad as the time James Bond surfed a tidal wave and equally cringe-worthy. Have them ambushed by the soldiers, you can have the same result with far more credibility and emotional resonance. It's difficult to feel too sorry for people who fling themselves off cliffs, shooting grappling arrows, only to Tarzan into a 8.22 mm round fired by a man with probably a fortnight's basic training. These women came across more Cirque Du Soleil than Amazon warrior, but on the plus side; if their island ever sinks under rising tides caused by global warming, they've got a steady career in Vegas just waiting for them. Three shows a day and all the shrimp they can eat. Yum.6. The sidekicks were a confused mess. I'm not against the idea of having a disparate group of mercenaries all fighting for various things with ambiguous morality, in fact it was quite a good idea to teach Diana the nuance of human relationships and interactions. That said, the characters were poorly-fleshed out and didn't really serve much purpose. It felt like the director couldn't decide whether they wanted comedy sidekicks, or Saving Private Ryan type tragic soldiers, and so chose the former, but scripted the latter. What we ended up with was comedy sidekicks without the comedy, which was the worst of all worlds. My solution to this is simple, don't try to make them all individual characters with poorly thought out back-stories, that don't come to anything (like the sniper who couldn't shoot) - let them fulfill their destinies as comedy-sidekicks who make the audience laugh. You can still add serious moments, like when the Native American is talking about how his land was stolen by Chris Pine's people and Diana's criticism of his mercenary actions suddenly rings childish and hollow. That was a great moment, probably the best in the film in fact. By interspersing comedy banter with serious moments like those, you can created a much more powerful effect than by explicitly giving every one of them a tragic backstory, but never exploring it beyond hearing them complain a bit because you think it gives your movie substance.   \n",

film, I wished that I could go all out Adam Sandler in that Click movie and fastforward through the meaningless clips that is this film. And the saddest thing is, this is the best film that DC has made. Helen Keller would have made a better film if all she had were a bunch of gerbils to work with. But then again, that's not much different from the producers of this film.\\n                \\n                    3 out of 9 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes.

In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.</td>\n",

It might work on the Dark Knight but we want Superman to be well super.Aquaman is enjoyable enough nonsense. It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur.

Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time.

Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) first foe is Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) and then his half-brother King and then everyone except Amber Heard.Now Arthur cannot become King until he either pulls the sword from the stone or the lost Trident from King Atlan. This isn't any Trident. It is made will Posiden steel and has a genuine Corinthian leather grip. The script raised some questions. Why is Aquaman desperately hanging on to the edge of a roof when he can jump out of a perfectly good airplane without a parachute? And why would he take a slow-moving fishing boat anywhere? They attempted to make Amber Heard's first time on the surface cute but not clever.

With James Wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the Saw franchise (one of the most important ones that is), there is experience at the helm. And he really brings a lot of humor into it - like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from that.But for every scene like that, you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top, you would suspect him to be comical (no pun intended), but he is dead serious.

       "      <td>The movie is visually impressive, I'll give it that. The underwater battle scene with opposing sides on sea horses and sharks was exceptionally well done. Story wise, though, it was fairly formulaic, and quite honestly, after about the first hour or so, I started getting bored with it. The dialog in particular was rather mundane for such a high profile movie coming out of the DC Comics universe. When Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) response to one of his beleaguered foes, (can't even remember who that was now), was 'Screw you!\", I could only groan in embarrassment. This is not what I expected to be coming from the mouth of the future King of Atlantis.I thought Jason Momoa was a very good choice for the Aquaman role. He has a regal bearing even before his destiny is revealed and I think he's a credit to the DC universe. Maybe it was Amber Heard's brilliantly rendered red hair, but I couldn't warm up to her character as Mera, Aquaman's future queen. The rest of the A-list cast was generally OK, although personally, I don't think Nicole Kidman should come anywhere near super-hero movies based on comic books.Though my rating of the movie is favorably high, it's all due to the cinematography and capable CGI utilized by the film makers. The after credits sequence sets up the sequel with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who didn't impress me this time around as the second tier villain behind King Orm (Patrick Wilson). His look was kind of cheesy and too cartoony for my tastes, perhaps a bad harbinger for the follow up Aquaman flick.As an aside, I couldn't get over the huge amount of one line reviews this picture has here on IMDb since it came out. They really offer nothing in the way of an individual writer's support or distaste for the movie other than to say they like it or hated it. Could do that in a tweet. I guess that says I'm in favor of going back to the ten line requirement that IMDb used to have.</td>\n",

Basically in Maine, lighthouse keeper Thomas \"Tom\" Curry (Temuera Morrison) rescues princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater nation of Atlantis during a storm. She stays on land, they fall in love and have a son, Arthur (Kaan Guldur and Otis Dhanji), who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms. Atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, she gives her loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) the mission to train Arthur. With his guidance, Arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the Atlanteans for being a half-breed and ultimately leaves Atlantis behind. One year after Steppenwolf's invasion, Arthur (Jason Momoa) confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a nuclear submarine. Their leader, Jesse Kane (Michael Beach), is trapped under rubble during the confrontation, he forces his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to leave him behind to drown, David vows revenge against Arthur. David later targets Atlantis at the behest of King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's younger half-brother and ruler of Atlantis who plans to declare war on the surface. King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren) swears allegiance to Orm's cause, but his daughter Mera (Amber Heard), who is betrothed to Orm, refuses to aide them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, she earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tidal wave sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, he says if he can find the Trident of Atlan, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis' first ruler, he will reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape, while Arthur is captured, Orm visits Arthur in captivity and tells him Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son, he blames Arthur and the surface for her death. Orm offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava, Orm has the upper hand, but Arthur is rescued by Mera. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the Sahara Desert to find information about the trident, a holographic message found in a chamber beneath the desert leads them to Sicily, where they retrieve the trident's coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm provides David with Atlantean armour and weaponry and sends him to stop them, he imprisons Vulko after learning of his betrayal, and coerces the remaining kingdoms of Atlantis to pledge allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface. In Sicily, David, now calling himself Black Manta, ambushes Arthur and Mera and injures Arthur before falling off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to find the trident, she encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by amphibious monsters known as The Trench, they manage to fend them off and enter a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the centre of the Earth. They Arthur is shocked to be reunited with Atlanna, she was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes, but she escaped them and reached the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since. Arthur must face mythical leviathan Karathen (Dame Julie Andrews), who guards the trident, he voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proves his worth and is able to reclaim the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Arthur, Mera, and Atlanna lead an army of marine creatures in battle against Orm and his followers, it is after learning that Arthur wields the trident and is the true king that the followers renounce their obedience to Orm. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his half-brother's life, Orm accepts his fate after seeing that Arthur has found and rescued their mother. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side. During the credits, Black Manta is rescued by Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), he agrees to take the scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis to the underwater kingdom in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur. Also starring Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, Graham McTavish as King Atlan, Leigh Whannell as Cargo Pilot, John Rhys-Davies as the voice of the Brine King and Djimon Hounsou as the voice of King Ricou. Momoa does a great job as the charismatic Atlantean prince who has a destiny, Heard is compelling as his sexy red-head sidekick, Wilson is rather stiff as the villain, Kidman is really likeable, and Lundgren does alright as well. I will admit most of the dialogue is cheesy, it is ridiculous at times, and it is perhaps a little too long, but the special effects going underwater and on land are brilliant, and the fast-paced fight and explosive sequences are engaging, it is fun to watch, a worthwhile superhero action adventure.

Already a\\nsequel is in the works, in fact this film ends on an uncertain note setting up the\\nstory line for the sequel.Lighthouse keeper Temura Morrison finds a woman with a trident on his beach\\nand takes her in. Nicole Kidman is the woman and she's the queen of the under\\nsea kingdom of Atlantis and she's running away from all that. The two fall in\\nlove and have a kid who grows up to be Jason Momoa.But before that some Atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap Kidman.\\nThey're all killed, but Kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm her\\nson.One would have to be blind not to miss the parallels between the story of the\\nSword And The Stone and Aquaman. Momoa's earth name is Arthur Curry for\\nthat matter. Now all grown up and quite fit and cut he's summoned to Atlantis to claim the crown. But first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rock\\nsomewhere in the sea. Can it get plainer than that.Aquaman also has a surface enemy in the son of a pirate whose father he killed\\nwhen they were capturing a submarine.I did like the computer graphic special effects.used and loved the fantasy sea\\nworld that was created.I can hardly wait for the sequel.   \n",

It's not particularly awful, it's just that I felt indifferent towards it, particularly with a hackneyed storyline that goes through all of the motions without ever offering much in the way of originality or innovation. Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes. An inflated running time and juvenile script had me feeling like this was a NEMO sequel at times, and it all ends in a climax that just goes for CGI effect after CGI effect, ad nauseum.

Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing.   \n",

One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy. But I won't be looking at it again.   \n",

Audiences do not want dark, moody superheroes. It might work on the Dark Knight but we want Superman to be well super.Aquaman is enjoyable enough nonsense. It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur. It injects fun as long as you do not take it all seriously.The movie begins with a lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry rescuing Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater realm of Atlantis.Two worlds collide, they fall in love and have a baby boy. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film. It is overlong but at least it did not end up in a watery grave.   \n",

The film works and is supported by great cast and special effects. James Wan shifts from horror genre and makes a good adventure film. Names such as Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren support this great production with the gorgeous Amber Heard. Looking forward for the sequel.

Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) first foe is Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) and then his half-brother King and then everyone except Amber Heard.Now Arthur cannot become King until he either pulls the sword from the stone or the lost Trident from King Atlan. This isn't any Trident. It is made will Posiden steel and has a genuine Corinthian leather grip. The script raised some questions. Why is Aquaman desperately hanging on to the edge of a roof when he can jump out of a perfectly good airplane without a parachute? And why would he take a slow-moving fishing boat anywhere? They attempted to make Amber Heard's first time on the surface cute but not clever. Are Atlantians the only sea mammals that never have to breathe air?I couldn't help but think of Avatar...this needs a 3D IMAX. Superman does not die in the end.Guide: language was a little salty.   \n",

Did they lose it? Or was it just the overall power of Marvel that just seemed to squash DC? With James Wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the Saw franchise (one of the most important ones that is), there is experience at the helm. And he really brings a lot of humor into it - like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from that.But for every scene like that, you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top, you would suspect him to be comical (no pun intended), but he is dead serious. Shame for missing out on something that could have been really great. Jason Momoa on the other hand is having a lot of fun. And all the cast is having a lot of fun (maybe even the crazy villain in between takes, definitely not on camera). A lof women (and some men) will love this regardless of story, just being visually \"attracted\" to it and that is ok. For everyone else, you can have fun with this if you don't overthink it\\n                \\n                    4 out of 10 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The underwater battle scene with opposing sides on sea horses and sharks was exceptionally well done. Story wise, though, it was fairly formulaic, and quite honestly, after about the first hour or so, I started getting bored with it. The dialog in particular was rather mundane for such a high profile movie coming out of the DC Comics universe. When Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) response to one of his beleaguered foes, (can't even remember who that was now), was 'Screw you!\", I could only groan in embarrassment. This is not what I expected to be coming from the mouth of the future King of Atlantis.I thought Jason Momoa was a very good choice for the Aquaman role. He has a regal bearing even before his destiny is revealed and I think he's a credit to the DC universe. Maybe it was Amber Heard's brilliantly rendered red hair, but I couldn't warm up to her character as Mera, Aquaman's future queen. The rest of the A-list cast was generally OK, although personally, I don't think Nicole Kidman should come anywhere near super-hero movies based on comic books.Though my rating of the movie is favorably high, it's all due to the cinematography and capable CGI utilized by the film makers. The after credits sequence sets up the sequel with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who didn't impress me this time around as the second tier villain behind King Orm (Patrick Wilson). His look was kind of cheesy and too cartoony for my tastes, perhaps a bad harbinger for the follow up Aquaman flick.As an aside, I couldn't get over the huge amount of one line reviews this picture has here on IMDb since it came out. They really offer nothing in the way of an individual writer's support or distaste for the movie other than to say they like it or hated it. Could do that in a tweet. I guess that says I'm in favor of going back to the ten line requirement that IMDb used to have.   \n",
       "9  We first saw the popular DC Comics character when he joined the team in Justice League, this was the first full-length centred around him, and the sixth entry in the DC Extended Universe, which has been a mixed bag, I hoped for some improvement, directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring). Basically in Maine, lighthouse keeper Thomas \"Tom\" Curry (Temuera Morrison) rescues princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater nation of Atlantis during a storm. She stays on land, they fall in love and have a son, Arthur (Kaan Guldur and Otis Dhanji), who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms. Atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, she gives her loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) the mission to train Arthur. With his guidance, Arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the Atlanteans for being a half-breed and ultimately leaves Atlantis behind. One year after Steppenwolf's invasion, Arthur (Jason Momoa) confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a nuclear submarine. Their leader, Jesse Kane (Michael Beach), is trapped under rubble during the confrontation, he forces his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to leave him behind to drown, David vows revenge against Arthur. David later targets Atlantis at the behest of King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur's younger half-brother and ruler of Atlantis who plans to declare war on the surface. King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren) swears allegiance to Orm's cause, but his daughter Mera (Amber Heard), who is betrothed to Orm, refuses to aide them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, she earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tidal wave sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, he says if he can find the Trident of Atlan, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis' first ruler, he will reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape, while Arthur is captured, Orm visits Arthur in captivity and tells him Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son, he blames Arthur and the surface for her death. Orm offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava, Orm has the upper hand, but Arthur is rescued by Mera. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the Sahara Desert to find information about the trident, a holographic message found in a chamber beneath the desert leads them to Sicily, where they retrieve the trident's coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm provides David with Atlantean armour and weaponry and sends him to stop them, he imprisons Vulko after learning of his betrayal, and coerces the remaining kingdoms of Atlantis to pledge allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface. In Sicily, David, now calling himself Black Manta, ambushes Arthur and Mera and injures Arthur before falling off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to find the trident, she encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by amphibious monsters known as The Trench, they manage to fend them off and enter a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the centre of the Earth. They Arthur is shocked to be reunited with Atlanna, she was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes, but she escaped them and reached the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since. Arthur must face mythical leviathan Karathen (Dame Julie Andrews), who guards the trident, he voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proves his worth and is able to reclaim the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Arthur, Mera, and Atlanna lead an army of marine creatures in battle against Orm and his followers, it is after learning that Arthur wields the trident and is the true king that the followers renounce their obedience to Orm. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his half-brother's life, Orm accepts his fate after seeing that Arthur has found and rescued their mother. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side. During the credits, Black Manta is rescued by Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), he agrees to take the scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis to the underwater kingdom in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur. Also starring Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, Graham McTavish as King Atlan, Leigh Whannell as Cargo Pilot, John Rhys-Davies as the voice of the Brine King and Djimon Hounsou as the voice of King Ricou. Momoa does a great job as the charismatic Atlantean prince who has a destiny, Heard is compelling as his sexy red-head sidekick, Wilson is rather stiff as the villain, Kidman is really likeable, and Lundgren does alright as well. I will admit most of the dialogue is cheesy, it is ridiculous at times, and it is perhaps a little too long, but the special effects going underwater and on land are brilliant, and the fast-paced fight and explosive sequences are engaging, it is fun to watch, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. Good!   \n",
