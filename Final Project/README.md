## Context 
In recent years, we have seen many new movies with popular genres: fantasy, superhero.., and there are 2 companies dominating the ranking chart which are DC & Marvel. Both companies produce films based on comic book, with different superhero characters, however surprisingly, Marvel gained remarkable gross revenue (over 70%) compared to DC, with only 20% more than DC in terms of budget. 
- In order to contribute to the success of a movie, there are many factors such as producers, distributors, marketing, rating reviews..., 
- thus in the scope of this analysis, I choose rating review as an objective for my analysis to explore: 
- How are the rating reviews between Marvel & DC? 
- Is there any correlation between rating and revenue? 
- Understand better the feeling and engagement of audiences between both companies. The analysis is based on rating reviews from IMDB.
