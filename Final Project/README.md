## Context 
In recent years, we have seen many new movies with popular genres: fantasy, superhero.., and there are 2 companies dominating the ranking chart which are DC & Marvel. Both companies produce films based on comic book, with different superhero characters, however surprisingly, Marvel gained remarkable gross revenue (over 70%) compared to DC, with only 20% more than DC in terms of budget. 
- In order to contribute to the success of a movie, there are many factors such as producers, distributors, marketing, rating reviews..., 
- thus in the scope of this analysis, I choose rating review as an objective for my analysis to explore: 
- How are the rating reviews between Marvel & DC? 
- Is there any correlation between rating and revenue? 
- Understand better the feeling and engagement of audiences between both companies. The analysis is based on rating reviews from IMDB.

## üéØ Objectives 
**1. Understand better the feeling and engagement of audiences between both company.**

**2. Explore the rating reviews between DC & Marvel and is there any coorrelation between 2 variables ( rating & revenue)**

4. By using BOW features, we extracted the most common key words, which are mentioned in positive reviews from Marvel & DC
- We can see that Marvel audiences mentioned about name of favorite characters, showed their engagement with these adjectives (great, good, one of the best), also **1 interesting points** they tend to mention more about the fact : franchise sequence in Marvel, which is one of most points stimulate Marvel 's revenue

In term of audience emotions ( using NRC Lexical to get the indicator), Marvel gained around 20% trust from audiencens

5. When look at positive word cloud of DC: user also mentioned about character but mainly around Batman, DC fan seems pay attention more about the actors who stared at the role in movies since most keywords appeared with real name of actors, these engageing keywords also be mentioned (great, good...)

6.Lastly, in order to understand which topic are releated to user review, i designed some list of words, use BOW feature to find downd the number of words in each reviews.
- For example, from word cloud Marvel, we obtained the point that audience love the action sequence from Marvel series, there for i create a list which indicated about the curiosity , such as: 'post credit','easter egg','curious','eager','wait' to know in which topic Marvel recieved more psotive feedbacks.

- Curiosity topic associated 4.5x more with positive than negative reviews for Marvel movies and double than DC movies

- By contrast, as DC's user wrote more reviews about name of actors, the chart showed: in positive reviews Acting topic associated 4x more with positive than negative reviews for DC movies. The appealing acting of actors is a reason which leaded DC 's revenue

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Conclusions:
- Sentiment analysis shows a higher customer satisfaction with Marvel¬¥s top grossing movies than those of DC
- The high positive sentiment of the first Avengers movie might have led to the success of the Avengers movie sequence 
- Similar DC attempts such as Batman v Superman and Justice League have very low positive sentiment

- Marvel is successful in maintaining audience ‚Äòs engagement and attention to movies sequence

- Marvel has used the element of curiosity (post-credit scenes, easter-eggs) to drive positive sentiment
- This helps in keeping the discussion alive and bringing customers back to the cinema
